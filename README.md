Implementation of **"An Effective Hybrid Atrous Convolutional Network for Pixel-Level Crack Detection"**
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9410578

The model is very simple, yet effective for predicting the cracks. It can achieve better performance than other recent approaches on the crack detection. 


## Requirements
- Tensorflow
- [Keras]
